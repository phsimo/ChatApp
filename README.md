# ChatApp

Wondering how Skype or Yahoo messenger works?
Find your answer here in this project. Out of my curiosity, and I also got this question from time to time, 
I decided to create a simple program that demonstrates how a chat program works. You can find the source code in this project as well.

First, the main idea is to have a server that orchestrates and directs the flow of messages between clients. Note that this is not a peer-to-peer connection. 
The main challenge is to manage all the threads that handle receiving and sending messages.
